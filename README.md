# Lab 1

You need to use the `test.py`.

Please follow the steps below to complete the lab

- create the first variable as `first = "Hello"` or as `a = "Hello"`
- create the second variable as `second = "Class!"` or as `b = "Class!"`
- create a third variable as `third = first + second` or as `c = a + b`
- Use `print(third)` or as `print(c)` 
- run your program `test.py`, then you will see `HelloClass!`.
- Modify the code so that it displays `Hello Class!`
- You must use variable to create the string, simple print is not acceptable.
